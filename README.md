# CursesEditor

This is a basic TUI Text editor made with curses in Python and packaged using PyInstaller.

## Features

- **Simple and intuitive interface**: CursesEditor offers a clean and minimalistic interface, allowing you to focus on your text editing without any distractions.
- **File management**: Open, save, and create new text files directly from the editor.
- **Configurable keybindings**: Customize keyboard shortcuts to suit your preferences.
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: CursesEditor is designed to run on Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.

Make sure that you have windows-ncurses before using this project on Windows(have not yet verified that it is working)

## Installation

CursesEditor is packaged as a standalone executable using PyInstaller, so you don't need to install Python or any dependencies separately. Simply download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/BRArjun/TUITextEditor/releases) page and run the executable file.

For Linux and macOS users:

```bash
chmod +x TUITextEditor  # Make the file executable

```
